title: "Servo Overload Protection"
description: "This project note provides a design to try to protect an unprogrammable servo from overload risk caused by mechanical problems. This design uses an SLG46140V GreenPAK. There are two designs, the first one uses an absolute value for a failsafe PWM that sets when overload is detected. The second uses a delay block to increase or decrease the PWM duty cycle relative to the input when overload is detected."
