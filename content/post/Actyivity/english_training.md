## Intro

I don't know how to start again to learn english. I have larned english since my childhood, specifically since elementary school. From that I don't confidence enough to my self. Until now I still have problem to speak english well. 
But it's not a matter I hope. I still beliecve that language is not about how long I learn, but it's about how long I train and use this language to my daily activity. So I hope I can speak english automatically. 

Below are my english study plan:
1. Write any blog about daily learned/thought in english
2. Reviewing a book that I read to english
3. Tell 1 and 2
